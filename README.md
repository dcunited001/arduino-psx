# Arduino PSX Library

I'm putting this library on github so that it's accessible as a git submodule for my arduino
projects.

I originally found this library [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/PSXLibrary)
on the Arduino Playground.  More documentation on the PSX controller
hardware can be found [here](http://www.gamesx.com/controldata/psxcont/psxcont.htm).
